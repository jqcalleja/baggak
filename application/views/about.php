                        <p class="text-center fs-4">“BAGGAK” is the Iloko term for Morning Star, the first to shine at dawn before the coming out of the sun from the east. The term “BAGGAK” was taken as a way of commemorating one of the most observed characteristics of the owner’s father that is being an early riser and being an industrious person who worked as early as dawn. Son’s was taken after the four sons of the owner. This was how the name of the establishment, BAGGAK SON’Z Hotel and Restaurant was coined.</p>
                        <p class="text-center fs-4">The business establishment was conceived to create a place to experience excellent ambiance to relax and enjoy great tasting foods. A blueprint was made, first steps were executed and finally, Baggak Sonz Restaurant started in August 28, 2010.</p>
                        <p class="text-center fs-4">The establishment was a fine dine-in restaurant with few employees. Everything has turned well and the business became productive. Until such time, a swimming pool for adults and kids was constructed at the back of the restaurant to complement the business activity. The new attraction was noted as the pioneer swimming pool in town. More customers come and go. And there was a booming effect of the amenity.</p>
                        <p class="text-center fs-4">Baggak Restaurant with its swimming pool had a rapid growth and development because of its ambiance and efficient services offered by the employees. Aside from these, the setting is accessible since it is found along the highway and found in an area near to various institutions like banks, schools and other business establishments. The development of the establishment had grown and more opportunities for progress were felt. The owner thought of erecting a hotel for tourists and guests to stay a couple of days and nights or more. It was April 2016 when the hotel was built, inaugurated and was named Baggak Hotel. In front of its building is a spacious parking area, picnic groves and events place for any occasion. The restaurant and hotel combining their purposes made the establishment a frontline for training and seminars, catering services and hosting big events. It also contributes to the growth of tourism industry magnificent activities of Sanchez Mira. Aside from being a tourist destination of the town, it also serves as an avenue for employment among graduates of aligned courses to the workplace.</p>
                        <p class="text-center fs-4">At present, the Baggak Son’z Hotel and Restaurant is now named Baggak Resort. It is an establishment that is compared to a heart that beats for the people which we can consider a place to relax, to bond with family and friends and to feel at peace with the serenity of the place.</p>
